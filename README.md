### System
The-Serverless-Ecommerce-Platform  

### Actors
The actors are the buyers.

### Use case

Individuals can use the app to the e-commerce platform to buy products. In this case, the app must be able to receive orders, process payments, and communicate with the restaurant electronically. When the user shops the inventory and finds products his interested in, the user gets more information about the item and places an order by making payment for the item and giving the required information on how it should be delivered.

### Scenario
When a user first arrives on the application, the user is allowed to shop the inventory. The user shops the inventory and selects any product he's interested in to view detailed information about the product. If the user is satisfied with the product, its price, ratings, reviews e.t.c, the user then proceeds to add the item to his cart. The user can then decide to proceed to checkout or return to the home page to continue shopping. The user continues this process until he proceeds to checkout.
If the user is not currently signed into the application, the user is then prompted to sign in before it can proceed to checkout.

On the checkout page, the user is prompted to fill in his home address details where the item will be delivered. After the user has entered the delivery address, the user needs to select the payment method. The user can choose to pay with a credit/debit card or any other payment method available to the user.

After the card details are entered, the card details are verified and proceed to payment. Once the payment is successful, the order is successfully placed and an order confirmation receipt is sent to the user. The order details are also sent to the shipping system to start processing the shipping of the goods.
